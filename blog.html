      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I don't know what to say. I blog for the sake of blogging. I'll share it with family and friends, so this probably won't become massive, but who knows? So many stories of people thinking something wouldn't be big, and it's the next big thing. And, well, stories of people thinking it will be big, and I haven't even heard of it.</p>

      <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
      <h5>12 July 2025</h5>
      <p>Hey! You're here, finally! This is the blog of someone who prefers to remain anonymous. Unless I give you this link, whereupon I am not anonymous and I am your friend. And thus you know who I am. Obviously. But so that if anybody else stumbles upon this site, I am anonymous. An anonymous entity who probably isn't human, but does indeed (sadly) look like one. I'm not the first alien to look human, though. Can you name a few? I can list several from movies, tv shows, even songs. But alas, I can do nothing they can do (fly spaceships, phone home (I assure you I can't even remember my own phone number), be logical, play guitar, play 3D chess (kudos to those fans of that series who got the reference, you are in good hands here), or fight with a lightsaber). I can only sit here in my bedroom, overheating, and trying to connect my headphones so I listen to what my parents are calling rock and roll, but is actually just Brian Eno. I listen to a lot of things. Will tell my favourite bands and singers in  an upcoming post, but it is no easy task.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I'm creating this blog because I'm <b>(a)</b> running out of space in my diary and don't even start with buying a new one because I have a severe notebook-buying obsession and once I start I won't stop and <b>(b)</b>, I kinda think it would be fun to blog without confining it to things like fashion, travel, music, cooking, etc. But no worries! All those things <i>will</i> be covered, just I won't do only that like some blogs do. It's gonna be personal and broad in range. It's something you'll pick up over your coffee break to see if I'm still alive and if I will continue to be for a little while more. And I'll write it between coffee breaks too! Or less coffee breaks, as I'll be pretty busy over the summer, and more over lunch or after camp, if I have time. Won't be too regular. Sorry. There's plenty of other websites and blogs to check out. More interesting than mine probably. Or go get a hobby. I'm learning Latin (okay, wait, that's not my hobby, that's my studies), reviewing music in my cute little notebook I bought obsessively and justified buying it by filling it with observations of the 4/4 beat and similarities to other musicians, sleeping (wait, that's not a hobby either, who's in charge of this), writing songs, drawing animals, and arguing with Chat-GPT over a obscure fact that I know because I'm weird and also I read a lot.</p>
      <p>So, uh, that's all for now. If you know me and can contact me, just tell me what I should blog about next!</p>
